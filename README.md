# About the Project
This project is an effort to <b>enhance customers' overall experience at Myntra</b> by introducing a couple of new features for Myntra called <b>"Go Local"</b> and <b>"Myntra Walk In"</b>.<br>

The <b>"Go Local"</b> feature is an attempt to connect customers with their nearby local fashion vendors through Myntra's platform,
thereby ensuring customers a seamless access to locally curated products (alongwith the globally available products) at their
fingertips. This feature is an effort to help the local stores by adding more customers to them as well as marking Myntra's presence as <b>omnipresent store</b>.<br>

In order to cater to the needs of the customers, who love to try on their apparels before buying, a new <b>"Myntra Walk In"</b>
feature has been proposed, which books a schedule for them to visit local shops and try on the products listed on the shop's page.<br>

Integrating local shops with customers, not only amplifies the visibility of local products, but also <b>reduces "delivery, replacement
and return" time</b>.<br>
